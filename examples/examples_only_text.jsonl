{"text": "[S1]Hey, did you hear about that company called MoSi AI? [S2]MoSi AI? Yeah, I think I've heard of them. Aren't they the ones doing AI stuff? What new thing have they come up with now? [S1]Yeah, that's them! They recently launched this super hot new product called, um, Asteroid. [S2]Asteroid. That's a pretty cool name. Does it mean like the space rock? [S1]Yeah, I think that's what it means. Let me tell you, this thing is incredible. They say it's currently the most realistic, human-like conversational TTS model out there. [S2]Oh, TTS technology? You mean the text-to-speech thing? Aren't there already a lot of those on the market? What makes this one so special? [S1]Well, it's completely different. They say the voice produced by Asteroid sounds almost exactly like a real person talking. And it's super smooth and natural. Not at all like, you know, that stiff robotic tone."}
